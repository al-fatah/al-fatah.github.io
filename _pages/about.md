Welcome to my personal website! I'm **Alfatah Jalalludin**, a passionate and driven **DevOps Engineer** with a strong foundation in cloud infrastructure, automation, and continuous delivery pipelines.

I hold a **Bachelor of Computer Science** from the **University of Adelaide**, with focus areas in Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity. I also have a **Diploma in Electrical and Electronic Engineering** from **Singapore Polytechnic**. Most recently, I completed the **SkillsFuture Career Transition Programme (SCTP)** for DevOps Engineering with NTUC LearningHub, where I honed my skills in tools like **Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, GitHub Actions, and AWS**.

In addition to my technical background, I’m also actively exploring opportunities in **FinTech**, building on my interest and background in **Business and Finance**.

Feel free to explore my site for more on my projects, certifications, resume, and blog posts.

Let's connect — I’m currently open to roles in DevOps, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), and Cybersecurity.
